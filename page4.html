    <h2 id="ass1">Assignment 1</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Develop a static website on the topic of your interest. It can be a website of your favourite team, movie, band, pet, book, etc. Use the Web-representation technologies discussed during the first three lectures (HTML5 and CSS3). The visual appeal of your design is welcomed but not required; yet, avoid deliberately repulsive color combinations. Your website is expected to present meaningful information about the topic. The pages should be bigger than a paragraph, but smaller than a book chapter.</p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>Your website must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>have at least 5 pages with meaningful content</li>
      <li>use HTML5 semantic attributes for formatting (e.g. see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">here</a>)</li>
      <li>use images and video</li>
      <li>have links between pages, within pages, and to external page(s)</li>
      <li>have at least one table</li>
      <li>be optimised for search engines</li>
      <li>use consistent layout and colour scheme</li>
      <li>use CSS for formatting, including at least:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>several different styles for links</li>
        <li>several different styles for text</li>
        <li>styles for table elements</li>
        <li>cascading styles through selector spesificity</li>
        <li>style inheritance</li>
      </ul>
      <li>define all formatting styles in a separate CSS file</li>
      <li>be compliant with the HTML5 rules of W3C Markup Validation Service and the CSS3 rules of W3C CSS Validation Service</li>
      <li>to put it in other words: do not use any of the deprecated HTML elements or attributes (see for example here), do not use iframe either (one exeption - you can use it for embedding YouTube videos)</li>
      <li>render correctly at least in the current versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Maintain good coding style</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>use lower case element and attribute names</li>
      <li>use indentation for nested elements</li>
      <li>use quotation marks for attribute values</li>
      <li>always use alt attribute with img elements</li>
      <li>use meaningful names for CSS classes</li>
      <li>short CSS rules can be written on one line, but long rules need to occupy multiple lines</li>
      <li>use lower case file names</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>complete and submit your website in pairs</li>
      <li>a pair must be registered with the TA beforehand</li>
      <li>the website should be archived and submitted as a single zip through the BlackBoard system</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Academic integrity</h3>
    <p>The work should be done by and your peer only. You can rely on the support of teaching assistants and student assistants during the practicum time, but you are not allowed to use the code of other groups. It is also forbidden to use HTML generating services and programs. You are required to manually create both the HTML and the CSS code. You can use external sources for the content of your website, however, you must refer to them by linking and naming.</p>

    <h2 id="ass2">Assignment 2</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Develop a dynamic version of the website created in Assignment 1 using JavaScript (if necessary, you can change/extend the main theme). Use DOM methods, elements and events to interactively modify the content and appearance of your web-pages according to user actions. Use event listeners to process the events. Implement at least 1 case of event propagation (W3C model).</p>
    <p>Create an additional page whose main content part is constructed purely through DOM manipulation. It should represent a (small) structured knowledge base of your theme. Entries of this "Knowledge Base" should be objects of different classes. Their content should be shortened versions of the content constituting the rest of the Website. A class model of your theme should have at least 3 classes and at least 1 case of inheritance (can be more). Classes/objects should be connected between each other. Links should be provided to browse across connected entries of the knowledge base. Use ES6 classes and ES6-style object construction.</p>
    <p>Use external JavaScript libraries (<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>) to speed up the development. Implement a contextual menu that allows the user to change the appearance of particular elements on your web-pages.</p>
    <p>Add a "Plot" page to your website; use <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">Flot</a> library or any other to implement an interactive plot, supply it with data relevant to the topic of your website. The plot must by interactive, i.e. user's clicks on something in a plot should cause change in data visualisation.</p>
    <p>Extra credit assignment: a user can use the contextual menu also to copy, cut and paste content at any place of the Website. Page reloads should refresh HTML back to its original stage.</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>In addition to the requirements of Assignment 1, you need to ensure the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>separate scripting from the content</li>
      <li>the context menu should allow at least changing the weight of the font to bold and back, the style of the font to italic and back, and the color of the font (between several colors)</li>
      <li>the plot must be interactive</li>
      <li>Knowledge based shoud be generated, E6-style class-based, interconnected</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Maintain good coding style</h3>
    <p>In addition to the good coding style rules specified in Assignment 1:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>use camelCase notation when naming your methods, variables and classes</li>
      <li>use indentation when writing your JavaScript code</li>
      <li>use meaningful comments</li>
      <li>terminate JavaScript statements with a ";"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>complete and submit your website in pairs (a pair must be registered with the <a href="mailto:c.ferguson@uu.nl">TA</a> beforehand)</li>
      <li>the website should be archived and submitted as a single zip through the <a href="https://uu.blackboard.com/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">BlackBoard</a> system</li>
      <li>do not submit video files. Instead, link your videos from any online Web space or file hosting platform (your university WebSpace, Dropbox, etc.) or use video hosting services (such as YouTube).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Academic integrity</h3>
    <p>The work should be done by you and your peer only. You can rely on the support of teaching assistants and student assistants during practicums, but you are not allowed to use the code of other groups. It is also forbidden to use HTML generating services and programs. Avoid using JavScript generation technologies (e.g. TypeScript), as the resulting JavaScript might not follow the requirements specified above. You can use external sources for the content of your website, however, you must refer to them by linking and naming them.</p>
