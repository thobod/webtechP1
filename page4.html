      <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Develop a static website on the topic of your interest. It can be a website of your favourite team, movie, band, pet, book, etc. Use the Web-representation technologies discussed during the first three lectures (HTML5 and CSS3). The visual appeal of your design is welcomed but not required; yet, avoid deliberately repulsive color combinations. Your website is expected to present meaningful information about the topic. The pages should be bigger than a paragraph, but smaller than a book chapter.</p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>

      <p>Your website must:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>have at least 5 pages with meaningful content</li>
          <li>use HTML5 semantic attributes for formatting (e.g. see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">here</a>)</li>
          <li>use images and video</li>
          <li>have links between pages, within pages, and to external page(s)</li>
          <li>have at least one table</li>
          <li>be optimised for search engines</li>
          <li>use consistent layout and colour scheme</li>
          <li>use CSS for formatting, including at least:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>several different styles for links</li>
              <li>several different styles for text</li>
              <li>styles for table elements</li>
              <li>cascading styles through selector spesificity</li>
              <li>style inheritance</li>
          </ul>
          <li>define all formatting styles in a separate CSS file</li>
          <li>be compliant with the HTML5 rules of W3C Markup Validation Service and the CSS3 rules of W3C CSS Validation Service</li>
          <li>to put it in other words: do not use any of the deprecated HTML elements or attributes (see for example here), do not use iframe either (one exeption - you can use it for embedding YouTube videos)</li>
          <li>render correctly at least in the current versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Maintain good coding style</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>use lower case element and attribute names</li>
          <li>use indentation for nested elements</li>
          <li>use quotation marks for attribute values</li>
          <li>always use alt attribute with img elements</li>
          <li>use meaningful names for CSS classes</li>
          <li>short CSS rules can be written on one line, but long rules need to occupy multiple lines</li>
          <li>use lower case file names</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>complete and submit your website in pairs</li>
          <li>a pair must be registered with the TA beforehand</li>
          <li>the website should be archived and submitted as a single zip through the BlackBoard system</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Academic integrity</h3>
      <p>The work should be done by and your peer only. You can rely on the support of teaching assistants
        and student assistants during the practicum time, but you are not allowed to use the code of other
        groups. It is also forbidden to use HTML generating services and programs. You are required to manually
        create both the HTML and the CSS code. You can use external sources for the content of your website,
        however, you must refer to them by linking and naming.</p>
