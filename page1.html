      <h2>Grading</h2>
      <p>50% of the course grade you will earn individually at exams; another 50% - by completing group assignments. There will be two exams:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Midterm (20%)</li>
          <li>Final(30%)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>..and three programming assignments:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Assignment 1 (5%)</li>
          <li>Assignment 2 (15%)</li>
          <li>Assignment 3 (30%)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can retake the both exams at once during on the official retake date - 06/07/18.
        You cannot keep only a part of the retake grade. If you retake the exam, its entire grade will be used as 50% of your course grade. You cannot retake the assignments.</p>

      <p>If you want to get the best possible grade, treat the deadline for assignments as strict. A day ends at 23:59:59. If your submission is a second late, it is a day late. You still receive a grade for a late assignment, but for every extra day you lose 20% of the grade. Hence, after the late day #5 there is no point in submitting. Any assignment submitted later will not be graded.</p>
